A modern, minimalistic markdown editor for Windows.
## Why Another Markdown Editor?

Because none of the existing markdown editors satisfy all of the following:

- Minimalistic: no knowledge base, no zettelkasten, no fancy syntax sugar that are not compatible with other editors.
- Support Windows: I use Windows, and I don't want to buy a Mac.
- Free of charge and open source.
- Support inline math: I write a lot of math.
- Modern and minimalistic UI
- Support GitHub Flavored Markdown
- Can export (beautiful looking) PDF: Markdown PDF extension for VSCode is not my cup of tea.
- Few bugs (MarkText is too buggy for me)
