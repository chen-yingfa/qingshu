# Qingshu 轻书

A modern, minimalistic markdown editor for Windows.

## Why Another Markdown Editor?

Because none of the existing markdown editors satisfy all of the following:

- Minimalistic: no knowledge base, no zettelkasten, no fancy syntax sugar that are not compatible with other editors.
- Support Windows: I use Windows, and I don't want to buy a Mac.
- Free of charge and open source.
- Modern and minimalistic UI
- Support GitHub Flavored Markdown + LateX (including inline math).
- Can export (beautiful looking) PDF
  - It should support syntax highlighting for code, footnotes, etc.
  - Markdown PDF extension for VSCode is not my cup of tea.
- Few bugs (MarkText is too buggy for me)
- Better support for CJK characters
  - Support font that correctly display full-width CJK punctuation marks.
  - Can correctly do word segmentation when moving cursor while holding down CTRL.
  - Can automatically add space between CJK and latin letters for more appealing text.
- WYSIWYG
